THERE ARE TWO PROJECT IN THIS DIRECTORY 


PROJECT 1:credit_card_fraud_detection
DESCRIPTION-:Logistic regression is used in credit card fraud detection by modeling the probability of a transaction being fraudulent 
based on input features like transaction amount, location, and time. It classifies transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent by 
fitting a logistic curve to the data. The model learns from historical fraud patterns to identify suspicious transactions in real-time, 
helping prevent financial losses for cardholders and issuers. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, 
evaluation, and deployment in a production environment for continuous monitoring. Advanced techniques like ensemble learning and anomaly 
detection can complement logistic regression for improved fraud detection accuracy.

At last we use streamlit to deploy app and make a user interface

PROJECT 2:titanic_survival_prediction
DESCRIPTION:Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, such as predicting survival (1 for survived,0 
for not survived) on the Titanic dataset. It models the probability of survival based on input features like age, gender, and ticket class,
using a sigmoid function to map inputs to a range of 0 to 1. The model learns coefficients for each feature to make predictions, with higher 
coefficients indicating stronger impact on survival likelihood. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly 
used to assess model performance.

At last we use NGORK and FLASK to deploy this app and make it user friendly
