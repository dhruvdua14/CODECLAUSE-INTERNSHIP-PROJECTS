THERE ARE THREE PROJECT IN THIS REPOSITORY
PROJECT 1:fraud_detection
Description-:Online payment fraud detection using decision trees involves constructing a tree-like model where each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (fraud or legitimate). The decision tree algorithm recursively splits the data based on attribute values, aiming to maximize information gain or minimize impurity at each step. By training the model on historical transaction data labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent, it learns patterns indicative of fraud. During inference, new transactions are passed through the decision tree, and the path they take determines the predicted class (fraudulent or legitimate). Decision trees offer interpretability, scalability, and efficiency in detecting fraudulent activities in online payments. Regular updates and optimization of the decision tree model are crucial to adapt to evolving fraud patterns and maintain accuracy.


PROJECT 2:credit_card_fraud_detection
DESCRIPTION-:Logistic regression is used in credit card fraud detection by modeling the probability of a transaction being fraudulent 
based on input features like transaction amount, location, and time. It classifies transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent by 
fitting a logistic curve to the data. The model learns from historical fraud patterns to identify suspicious transactions in real-time, 
helping prevent financial losses for cardholders and issuers. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, 
evaluation, and deployment in a production environment for continuous monitoring. Advanced techniques like ensemble learning and anomaly 
detection can complement logistic regression for improved fraud detection accuracy.

PROJECT 3: crop_disease_identification
DESCRIPTION:Crop disease identification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) involves training a model to classify images of crops into healthy or diseased categories. Initially, a dataset comprising images of both healthy and diseased crops is collected and labeled. Preprocessing steps such as resizing and normalization are applied to the images. A CNN architecture is designed, typically comprising convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. The model is trained using the labeled dataset, adjusting its parameters through backpropagation to minimize classification error. During inference, the trained model can accurately predict whether a given crop image is healthy or diseased, aiding farmers in early disease detection and management. Regular validation and testing ensure the model's generalization to new data. Continuous refinement and updates to the model improve its accuracy and applicability in real-world agricultural settings.
